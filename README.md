# Image Embedding
A MediaPipe-based image embedding extension for [Xcratch](https://xcratch.github.io/)

This extension provides blocks to create embeddings from images using MediaPipe's Image Embedder model and calculate cosine similarity between embedding vectors. These features enable image comparison and similarity detection in Scratch projects.

### Features

- **Embed Images**: Convert images into embedding vectors using MediaPipe's Image Embedder model
- **Compare Images**: Calculate cosine similarity between two embedding vectors to measure image similarity
- **Custom Model Path**: Configure the model asset path for the image embedder
- **Flexible Input**: Works with image data URLs

### Available Blocks

1. **embed [IMAGE]** - Returns an embedding vector (comma-separated values) for the given image data URL
2. **cosine similarity of [VECTOR1] and [VECTOR2]** - Computes the cosine similarity between two embedding vectors (returns a value between -1 and 1, where 1 means identical)
3. **set model asset path to [PATH]** - Sets a custom path for the MediaPipe model assets
4. **get model asset path** - Returns the current model asset path
